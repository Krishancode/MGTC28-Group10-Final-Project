MGTC28 Group 10 Project plan
By combining data analysis and business strategy, we aim to address Kenvue Inc.'s challenge: "Which need states should be promoted and when, and how should the trade spend be optimized/adjusted?".  This approach would involve thorough data analysis, insightful visualizations, and the development of a targeted go-to-market strategy.
